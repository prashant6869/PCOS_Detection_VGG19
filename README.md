# PCOS_Detection_VGG19

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) impacts an estimated 8-13% of women of reproductive age, with up to 70% remaining undiagnosed globally. In the proposed methodology, medical images of ovarian ultrasounds are processed through VGGNet-19, extracting high-level features from the images. Simultaneously, clinical text reports, containing valuable diagnostic information, are subjected to a zero-shot learning text classification model. This hybrid architecture enables the utilization of both visual and textual data sources for enhanced PCOS detection. The fusion model leverages VGGNet-19's prowess in image feature extraction, capturing intricate patterns and details within ultrasound images. XGBoost, known for its robust classification capabilities, processes the extracted features to classify PCOS cases effectively. The proposed system uses both textual and image data for early PCOS detection. The textual data has been made using various factors, including dietary habits, daily routines, and more. The proposed system has the capability for early detection of PCOS while simultaneously identifying concurrent health conditions associated with PCOS like diabetes hypertension etc. The dataset encompasses various parameters, including patient-specific information such as age, weight, height, and BMI, as well as medical measurements like Hb, cycle characteristics, hormone levels, and more. The deep fusion model achieved an accuracy of 99.6%.
